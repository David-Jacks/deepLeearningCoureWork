You will need to have these libraries before you can run the python files:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

What I recommend: 
first create a vitual environment
install the above libraries in that environment
go ahead and run the files

Note: 
The dataset used for the training was not added to the submission
Hence it is expected that you get access to the data and just pass it to variables that store the path in the my_utils.py file
